GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

FEATURE I ADD:
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.

GOALS:
- New Style.css (arcade??)
- Button to swithch styles
- Add more Dices
